# Progress Journal

This is my progress journal. I plan to use this journal to help keep me accountable to my goals by: 
1. Documenting / measuring whether I have met my goals. 
1. Developing a single source of documentation about the concepts I've learned.
1. Reward myself for meeting milestones.
1. Demonstrate my progress to myself.


## Progress Entries

  **What I Learned Today:** 
  1. How to 'strikethrough' text in github markdown. 
    1. Use `~~text~~`


  **Learning Activity:** Create this repo, update the README.md and start this progress journal. 
  
  **Comments:** 
  * Today I created this repo. This, I think, will be a big step in the direction of helping me focus my energy. I'm planning to document my 'learning activities' here, as well as any thoughts, 'aha' moments, frustrations, interests, etc. that I can use for motivation or to help me identify areas I enjoy and plan to dive into deeper. 
  * I have to get better with version control. Basic things trip me up and slow me down at this point.  



  **Learning Activity:** Video - [Julie Pagano: It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech - PyCon 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)
  
  **Comments:** I think most people today are aware of "Imposter Syndrome" and many of us believe we have it to some degree. I think I've felt some level of IS since I taught my first ESL lesson to Hungarian students in 2010. I am able to recognize that I'm often the person who arrives to meetings most prepared, but also that I do this because I feel like I am likely not the most knowledgable. Julie mentions the feeling that there is constantly so much more to learn, and we have to 'do all the things' just to keep up with our peers in her video. Trying to do all the things all the time leads to burnout. Julie made me realize that I need to focus my efforts, and take the time to recognize the progress I am making. 


**Learning Activity:**

    - [How computers calculate - ALU (video)](https://youtu.be/1I5ZMmrOfnA)
    - [Registers and RAM (video)](https://youtu.be/fpnE6UAfbtU)
    - [The Central Processing Unit (CPU) (video)](https://youtu.be/FZGugFqdr60)
    - [Instructions and Programs (video)](https://youtu.be/zltgXvg6r3k)
    
**Comments:** Love these videos, Carrie Ann presents the inner workings of computer chips in a very accessible way, working through the details of a basic computer's architecture before abstracting each item and showing it's interactions with other parts. (I did have to watch several parts more than once, but it is not _too_ difficult to follow along. These videos perfectly recapped some of the information I learned in my undergrad level Computer Architcture course.) Admittedly, computer architecture really doesn't interest me, but I certainly have respect for the ingenuity!
