# Progress Journal

This is my progress journal. I plan to use this journal to help keep me accountable to my goals by: 
1. Documenting / measuring whether I have met my goals. 
1. Developing a single source of documentation about the concepts I've learned.
1. Reward myself for meeting milestones.
1. Demonstrate my progress to myself.

  **What I Learned Today:**
  1. How to 'strikethrough' text in github markdown. 
    1. Use `~~text~~`


  **Learning Activity:** Today I created this repo. This, I think, will be a big step in the direction of helping me focus my energy. I'm planning to document my 'learning activities' here, as well as any thoughts, 'aha' moments, frustrations, interests, etc. that I can use for motivation or to help me identify areas I enjoy and plan to dive into deeper. 
  **Comments:** I have to get better with version control. Basic things trip me up and slow me down at this point.  

  **Learning Activity:** Video - [Julie Pagano: It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech - PyCon 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)
  **Comments:** I think most people today are aware of "Imposter Syndrome" and many of us believe we have it to some degree. I think I've felt some level of IS since I taught my first ESL lesson to Hungarian students in 2010. I am able to recognize that I'm often the person who arrives to meetings most prepared, but also that I do this because I feel like I am likely not the most knowledgable. Julie mentions the feeling that there is constantly so much more to learn, and we have to 'do all the things' just to keep up with our peers in her video. Trying to do all the things all the time leads to burnout. Julie made me realize that I need to focus my efforts, and take the time to recognize the progress I am making.
